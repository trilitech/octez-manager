## Why Octez Manager?

Managing Tezos infrastructure traditionally requires:
- Manual configuration of multiple config files
- Creating and managing systemd unit files
- Handling user permissions and directories
- Downloading and importing snapshots manually
- Monitoring logs across multiple services

Octez Manager handles all of this through a unified interface, whether you prefer the command line or an interactive TUI.
