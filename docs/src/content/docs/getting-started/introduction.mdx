# What is Octez Manager?

<Aside type="caution" title="Experimental Software">
Octez Manager is in early development. It is recommended for **testnet use only** (Shadownet, Ghostnet). We do not guarantee backward compatibility with future versions. Always maintain backups of your keys and data.
</Aside>

Octez Manager is a CLI and TUI tool for deploying and managing Tezos infrastructure.

## The problem

Setting up Tezos infrastructure requires:

- Writing systemd unit files
- Managing environment configurations
- Handling user permissions
- Downloading and importing snapshots
- Monitoring logs across services

## The solution

One command:

```bash
octez-manager install-node --instance shadownet --network shadownet
```

Or an interactive TUI:

## Services

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Node** | L1 node with automatic snapshot bootstrap |
| **DAL Node** | Data Availability Layer |
| **Baker** | Block production and attestations |
| **Accuser** | Double-baking/endorsing detection |

## Modes

**User mode** — Services run as your user. Good for testing.

```bash
octez-manager
```

**System mode** — Dedicated service users, proper isolation. For production.

```bash
sudo octez-manager
```
